Hi Pankaj,

During the deployment, the column workspace_alias_name is not getting added to the workspace table. Because of this, the other scripts dependent on this column are failing.

I checked the script and the order looks fine to me, but Iâ€™m not sure what could be the root cause. Could you please check and update?
