Hi Rajagopal,

I noticed that there is a duplicate entry for the key MarvelReportConfig:EmailFrom in the TEST environment. Looks like there is some issue with the script, as duplicate entries have got inserted, which was not expected. I am not sure of the root cause, but can you please get it reviewed with Pankaj?
