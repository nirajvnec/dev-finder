Hi Raja Gopal,

I hope you're doing well. With the new test environment set up, I believe we don't directly handle the deploymentâ€”Melia will take care of it. But do we need to provide her with a build or some kind of release link for NILIA? Also, could you please clarify how the API and DB scripts will be handled in this context?
