Hi Rajagopal,

I noticed that there is a duplicate entry for the key MarvelReportConfig:EmailFrom in the TEST environment. I’m not sure why this got inserted twice, but it seems the script might be allowing duplicate inserts.

Could you please work with Pankaj to review the script and make sure it’s adjusted so that duplicate entries are not created going forward?
